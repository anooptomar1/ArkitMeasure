# ArkitMeasure
Arkit demo to measure the distance between 2 points in world coordinates
ArkitMeasure provides the code to measure the distance between 2 points in Arkit.

Below are the major functions covered in this topic:
1) func renderer(_ renderer: SCNSceneRenderer, updateAtTime time: TimeInterval)  - Delegate called by Arkit at specific intervals to allow handle UI.
2) func drawLine(from: SCNVector3, to: SCNVector3) - Function to draw line using SCNGeometrySource and SCNGeometryElement.

Code explanation soon will be provided in https://www.machinethinks.com

Below is the screenshot from the app.
